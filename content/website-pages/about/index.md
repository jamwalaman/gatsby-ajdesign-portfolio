title: About
---
I have a passion for design and web development, which shows in the work I've done.

I have been lucky enough to work with a range of clients. I'm particularly proud of having the opportunity to work with charities and creating an online presence for them.

Even though I've developed websites using content management systems like WordPress and Silverstripe (also Decap CMS which is what I used for my portfolio website), I'm not attached to just using one platform to build a website. In the end, it's about what can get you the best result.
